DaysSince iOS Application

I created this application to help me keep track of things I need to do that have a regular frequency, but don't lend themselves well to a rigid schedule.

For example, I *should* replace the air filter in my HVAC system every 3 months. I could put a reminder on my calendar on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1. However, if I don't change it on April 1 because it's not really ready and I wait until May 1, then I definitely don't need to replace it again on July 1. I want to wait until August 1 which will mess up all of my future reminders.

With this app, I can assign *roughly* how often I want to do something and when I last did it and it will remind me when to do it next. Once I do it again, the clock starts over.

Features:
* List of tasks ordered by the next time it is due
* History of everytime the task is completed with ability to record notes
* Statistics about how often you actually do it
* Flexibility to include things that don't necessary have a fixed interval (i.e. Went to a movie)
* Configurable notifications
